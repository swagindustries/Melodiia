- Add Collection model to render easily standard output with collections #12

  Be careful as it MAY break the BC of your application if you redefined the `SerializeOnKernelView` class
- New Documentation controller, learn more in documentation or see the example in the test application

### Changed
- New PHP minimum requirement is PHP 7.3
- Huge BC Break on namespaces. You need to rename all classes used to SwagIndustries instead of Biig
- BC Break: the form option `customDataMapper` is now `melodiiaDataMapper`
- BC Break: on CRUD classes. It's big changes time. So we made the security optional for crud controllers, this has a
  consequence on their constructor
- BC Break: `CrudableModelInterface` is now `MelodiiaModel`
- The ApiType now uses a custom request handler. It makes handling api request easier and removes some code
  in controllers. You should now use `handleRequest($request)` on your form. Here is a list of other changes:
    - An api form cannot be "not submitted" anymore after a call to `handleRequest`
    - In case the input data is invalid, a form error is add to the form
    - There is a new optional option on the ApiType: `clear_missing` but its value is automatically guessed by default
      to follow HTTP verbs.
- Removal of the dependency to zend json (thanks to php 7.3 upgrade)
- BC Break: the ApiResponse now contains also headers. If you do not extends another response you will need to add the missing method
- BC Break: many many many changes of namespaces because the Bridge do not exists anymore.

## Removed
